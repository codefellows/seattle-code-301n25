# Class 08 Lecture Notes

- Introducing Regular Expressions 101
- What is Regex?
  - Regular expressions, often shortened to "regex" or "regexp", are patterns that help programmers match, search, and replace text.
  - Regular expressions are very powerful, but can be hard to read because they use special characters to make more complex, flexible matches.
  - A regular expression can be a single character, or a more complicated pattern.
  - Regex is a means of identifying patterns in strings. When you search for patterns in a string, you can use this search pattern(the Regex pattern) to describe what you are searching for.
  - We commonly use Regex to validate input, replace character patterns with other characters, refer to character patterns in a string or to parse through data collected with web scraping(data science/machine learning).
  - Regex is used in almost all programming languages...JavaScript, Java, VB, C#, C / C++, Golang, Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, R, and many others!
