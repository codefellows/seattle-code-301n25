# Class 07 Lecture Notes

- Feedback Overview
  - "Code challenges, they are great to get the brain going on the subjects were woking. Sometimes when doing a project you can only go back to the code and look the project itself, but going back to the code challenges allow you to see different way's you solves it using .map, .filter etc...."
  - "The code reviews have been helpful"
  - "Code Fellows should host public mock interviews and live public code challenges on a weekly basis."
  - "I still am unfamiliar with much of react"
  - "I found that pair programming and going to other classmates was a very helpful method of making it through some of the material."
  - "I have not enjoyed the portfolio, partially because I don't think portfolios should be made from template, but moreover because I don't like the template that much."
  - Hexx doesn't call on some peope as much as they do others.

- String & Array Methods
  - Repl.it Demo: <https://replit.com/@HexxKing1/301n25-Code-Challenge-String-and-Array-Methods#index.js>
  - Introducing `slice()`, `splice()`, `split()` and `join()`
  - STRING.SPLIT(): splits a string into an array of substrings, and returns the new array.
    - DOCS:
      - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/split>
      - <https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_split.asp>
    - INPUT:
      - separator(Optional): specifies the character where the string will be split
      - limit(Optional): limits the number of split items included in the returned array
    - OUTPUT:
      - An Array of strings, split at each point where the separator occurs in the given string.
    - KEY POINTS:
      - The separator characters are removed as the string is being "split".
      - The original string is not modified.
  - ARRAY.JOIN(): will iterate through an array and create a new string by concatenating the value of each element in the array with the character that you specify.
    - DOCS:
      - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join>
      - <https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_join.asp>
    - INPUT:
      - separator(Optional): specifies the character where the array elements will be joined. If omitted, the elements are separated with a comma
    - OUTPUT:
      - The string conversions of all array elements are joined into one string.
    - KEY POINTS:
      - If an element is undefined, null or an empty array, it is converted to an empty string.
      - Given no separator, join() will insert commas.
      - The original array is not modified
  - ARRAY.SLICE(): method returns selected elements in an array, as a new array.
    - DOCS:
      - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/SLICE>
      - <https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_SLICE.asp>
    - INPUT:
      - start(Optional): index at which to start slicing.
      - end(Optional): index before which to end the slice.
    - OUTPUT:
      - A new array containing the sliced elements.
    - KEY POINTS:
      - A negative index can be used as either input. Positive indexes start at the front of the array, negatives start at the end of the array.
      - If start is undefined, slice starts from the index 0.
      - If end is omitted, slice extracts through the end of the sequence (arr.length).
      - Slice does not alter the original array.
      - NOTE! There is a slice method for both arrays and strings.
  - ARRAY.SPLICE(): changes the contents of an array by removing or replacing existing elements and/or adding new elements in place.
    - DOCS:
      - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/splice>
      - <https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_SPLICE.asp>
    - INPUT:
      - start: index at which to start changing the array.
      - deleteCount(Optional): the number of elements in the array to remove from start.
      - itemsToBeAdded(Optional): The elements to add to the array, beginning from start.
    - OUTPUT:
      - An array containing the deleted elements.
      - If only one element is removed, an array of one element is returned.
      - If no elements are removed, an empty array is returned.
  - KEY POINTS:
    - splice() overwrites the original array.
    - returns an array containing the deleted elements.
