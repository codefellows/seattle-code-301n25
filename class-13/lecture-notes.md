# Class 13 Lecture Notes

- Feedback Overview
  - "Like how we're doing code review. Wish people would ask more questions but we have a shy bunch."
  - "Well this is 301 and I get the concept of doing more of the research which will be the standard in the field, but after talking with a few classmates I'm concerned that the general consensus is a feeling of being overwhelmed.  just concerned because a lot of them won't speak up and say how they feel."
  - "Even though this week was a lot of new information I was actually able to use my experience from classes in the past to help me keep up with this week."
  - "The code reviews are amazing because I like to see other ways I can change up my code or just see how other's think of ways to write code. "
  - "The backend is a bit confusing and very new to me"
  - "The career assignments are more of an after thought. I know everybody is focusing on grasping programming concepts right now and finishing the labs but growing your network professionally is extremely important. Without any sort of 'foot in the door', breaking into the tech industry from non traditional background is difficult. Even CS grads have a hard time doing it."
  - "I wish I had more time to work with the same partners, we're swapping quite quickly"
  - Found most helpful: "working in a team and also asking other teams for help. super nice!"
  - "It has been challenging trying to keep up with the new concepts"
  - "The load of work can be overwhelming with the labs"
