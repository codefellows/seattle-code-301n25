# Class 05 Lecture Notes

- Feedback Review
  - "Some days in night course we get extra time when everything is Done and no one has questions, but besides that everything went good."
  - "CODE REVIEW"
  - "the powerhour last saturday was sort of a let down. I think it's helpful for 102/201 students but 301 should be attending career development powerhour sessions."
  - "I found that the partner power hour was helpful solely for the format of the discussion. Directly covering topics related to coding and coding practices is a nice deviation from the previous power hours."
  - "Code Fellows should host more team building events to build the camaraderie in among the 'Fellows' in virtual campus. For example, 201, 301, 401 mixer."
  - "I am still learning React..."
  - "I received a little help from a classmate to point me in the right direction and that was all I needed."
  - "The only aspect that (I find least helpful) is the readings. I believe this is the case because of my lack of experience. If I had a stronger foundation as far as coding is concerned then I believe the readings would be more beneficial."
  - If you are the one person who did not fill out their Feedback assignment, you can still get that turned in! Plus, you get an easy grade for completing these!

- `array.reduce()`
  - <https://replit.com/@HexxKing1/301n25-Code-Challenge-reduce#index.js>
  - Perhaps the easiest-to-understand case for reduce() is to return the sum of all the elements in an array.
  - The reducer walks through the array element-by-element, at each step adding the current index value to the result from the previous step (this result is the running sum of all the previous steps) — until there are no more elements to add.
  - DOCS:
    - <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/reduce>
    - <https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_reduce.asp>
  - INPUTS:
    - A “reducer” function that takes four arguments:
      - previousValue AKA accumulator (the value resulting from the previous call to callbackfn)
      - currentValue AKA current index value (the value of the current element)
      - currentIndex Optional
      - array (the array to traverse) Optional
    - initialValue Optional
      - A value to which accumulator is initialized the first time the callback is called. If initialValue is specified, that also causes currentValue to be initialized to the first value in the array. If initialValue is not specified, previousValue is initialized to the first value in the array, and currentValue is initialized to the second value in the array.
  - OUTPUTS:
    - The value that results from running the “reducer” callback function to completion over the entire array.
  - KEY POINTS:
    - The reduce() method executes a reducer function for each value of an array.
    - reduce() returns a single value which is the function's accumulated result.
    - reduce() does not execute the function for empty array elements.
    - reduce() does not change the original array.

- Conditional Rendering in React
  - Only renders something when we want it to
  - Ternary allows us conditionally render different parts of our applications
  - City Explorer accepts a city name, draws a map, and then lists out some interesting data about the city, pulled from a remote data source (client + server!).
  - Today we will use a sample.json for dummy data. Next week, we will use real data coming from an API.
  - Use conditional logic to wait to display to the results until after the user has entered a city

- Routers in your Portfolio app
  - Routing (deciding what "page" to render) is a common feature of every application and web site. In React, it happens differently from traditional web pages.
  - What is Routing?
    - A link that switches content.
    - When clicked, a link will render a component in a spot on the page.
    - Can change out a single component within a page.
    - Or, it can can switch out a full page of content.
  - But how does it work under the hood?
    - react-router-dom v5.3 docs here: <https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/example/basic>
    - At the core of every React Router application should be a router component. For web projects, react-router-dom provides `<BrowserRouter>` and `<HashRouter>` routers. The main difference between the two is the way they store the URL and communicate with your web server.
    - A `<BrowserRouter>` uses regular URL paths. These are generally the best-looking URLs, but they require your server to be configured correctly. Specifically, your web server needs to serve the same page at all URLs that are managed client-side by React Router. Create React App supports this out of the box in development, and comes with instructions on how to configure your production server as well.
    - This site has 2 pages, all of which are rendered dynamically in the browser (not server rendered).
    - Although the page does not ever refresh, notice how React Router keeps the URL up to date as you navigate through the site. This preserves the browser history, making sure things like the back button and bookmarks work properly.
    - To use a router, just make sure it is rendered at the root of your element hierarchy. Typically you’ll wrap your top-level `<App>` element in a router.
    - A `<Switch>` looks through all its children `<Route>` elements and renders the first one whose path matches the current URL. Use a `<Switch>` any time you have multiple routes, but you want only one of them to render at a time.
    - If the current URL is `/about`, this route is rendered while the rest are ignored.
    - If none of the previous routes render anything, the "/" route acts as a fallback.
      - A route with path="/" will *always* match the URL because all URLs begin with a /. So that's why we put this one last of all.
      - Another possible solution is to use `<Route exact path="/">` (like we are doing in the Portfolio) which does match the entire URL.
    - You can think of the `Home` and `About` components as "pages" in your app.
