# Class 05 Lecture Notes

- Feedback Review
  - "Some days in night course we get extra time when everything is Done and no one has questions, but besides that everything went good."
  - "CODE REVIEW"
  - "the powerhour last saturday was sort of a let down. I think it's helpful for 102/201 students but 301 should be attending career development powerhour sessions."
  - "I found that the partner power hour was helpful solely for the format of the discussion. Directly covering topics related to coding and coding practices is a nice deviation from the previous power hours."
  - "Code Fellows should host more team building events to build the camaraderie in among the 'Fellows' in virtual campus. For example, 201, 301, 401 mixer."
  - "I am still learning React..."
  - "I received a little help from a classmate to point me in the right direction and that was all I needed."
  - "The only aspect that (I find least helpful) is the readings. I believe this is the case because of my lack of experience. If I had a stronger foundation as far as coding is concerned then I believe the readings would be more beneficial."
  - If you are the one person who did not fill out their Feedback assignment, you can still get that turned in! Plus, you get an easy grade for completing these!

- `array.reduce()`
  - <https://replit.com/@HexxKing1/301n25-Code-Challenge-reduce#index.js>
  - Perhaps the easiest-to-understand case for reduce() is to return the sum of all the elements in an array.
  - The reducer walks through the array element-by-element, at each step adding the current index value to the result from the previous step (this result is the running sum of all the previous steps) — until there are no more elements to add.

  - INPUTS:
    - A “reducer” function that takes four arguments:
      - previousValue AKA accumulator (the value resulting from the previous call to callbackfn)
      - currentValue AKA current index value (the value of the current element)
      - currentIndex Optional
      - array (the array to traverse) Optional
    - initialValue Optional
      - A value to which accumulator is initialized the first time the callback is called. If initialValue is specified, that also causes currentValue to be initialized to the first value in the array. If initialValue is not specified, previousValue is initialized to the first value in the array, and currentValue is initialized to the second value in the array.
  - OUTPUTS:
    - The value that results from running the “reducer” callback function to completion over the entire array.
  - KEY POINTS:
    - The reduce() method executes a reducer function for each value of an array.
    - reduce() returns a single value which is the function's accumulated result.
    - reduce() does not execute the function for empty array elements.
    - reduce() does not change the original array.
