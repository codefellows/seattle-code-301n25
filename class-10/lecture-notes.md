- In Memory Database
  - In-memory databases are purpose-built databases that rely primarily on memory for data storage, in contrast to databases that store data on disk or SSDs. In-memory data stores are designed to enable minimal response times by eliminating the need to access disks.

- Cache
  - it is simply an object that lives in a module in our server code.
  - We are goingt to store new API data in the cache object to look up later when the same query is requested.
- Cache Hit
  - the data requested is in the cache
- Cache Miss
  - the data requested is NOT in the cache
